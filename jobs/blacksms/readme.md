## What is the problem?

_In my own words_

1. start with an array of 0s
2. take in series of operations to perform on segments of the list
3. each operations consists of a starting/ending index within the array, and a number to add to each element within that range
4.

first solve the problem with arrays, then do a stdin solution

so I have a n2 solution

now we need an linear time solution?

we need to return only the largest number

it works fine using a nested for loop, but we can do it in linear time by keeping track of the highest number

we can keep track of the highest number

jk, we still have n \* m time

is there another way through?

it seems like n \* m is the fastest way through
how could we go faster?

we could do everything in one pass
