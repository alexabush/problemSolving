#Digital Cypher

Steps:

1.  Make a lookup table to assign each letter of the alphabet a unique number.
2.  We take in a word and convert it into its corresponding numbers (store numbers in an array).
3.  We add the digits from the key to each of the letter numbers (if array is longer than key, just start again from the beginning of the key)

We can do the conversion in a simple for loop

The adding will take a bit more work.
First we will need to convert the key into an array of numbers.
