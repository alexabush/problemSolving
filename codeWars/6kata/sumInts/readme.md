# Sum Ints

## What is the problem asking for?

The goal of this problem is to implement a function that will sum two integers WITHOUT using '+', '-' or reduce

## Brainstorm

This seems like a kind of problem that is more about knowing a specific edge case language feature than about problem solving, so I may just need to look the answer up.

How do I add numbers without '+'?
I could change the number to a different data type?
try and use concat?

Since the problem prohibits 'reduce', may I DO need to use an array method

## Resolution

So I looked up the answers and most of them are some sort of weird bitwise solution.

So I'm just going to skip this problem
