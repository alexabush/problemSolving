# Seven Sided Die

## What's the problem?

Generated a function that returns a random number 1 to 7 USING a function that returns a random number 1 to 5

## Brainstorm 1

So this is a harder version of the last problem.

Common denominator approach?

We could call random5 7 times?
Then do division?

The main problem is making getting a 7 as likely as getting any other number.

It's very hard to get 7 the way we're currently doing things.

Interview cake suggests we call rand5 multiple times

I'm still attached to the idea of calling it seven times, but I'm not sure why

Okay forget this problem
