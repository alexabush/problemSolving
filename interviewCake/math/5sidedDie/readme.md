# 5 Sided Die

## What is the problem?

We need make a function that returns a random integer from 1 to 5

## Brainstorm

Um...so this seems like the basic math.random forumla.

So...I'll just write it then?

JK we need to use a random number between 1 and 7 to implement our function

Made a new implemention which just redoes the random calculation if our random 1 to 7 function returns 6 or 7.

So....

The probability to generating each integer is still the same.

Ok so this answer is right. Cool.

...
?
