# Triangular Series

A triangular series is a series of numbers where each number could be the row of a equilateral triangle

_PS, I'm not sure if this is an actual thing or just something made up for the sake of a problem_

So [1,2,3,4,5] would be a triangular series because we could stack all these numbers to make an equaliteral triangle.

The sum of all the numbers in a triangular series is called a \*_triangular number_

A triangular series always starts with 1 and always increases by 1 for each new number added. The only thing that changes is how high we count up to.

Some properties of triangular series:

1. Pairs of high/low numbers will always add up to the same number
2. The pair sum value is the length of the series + 1

We can make a formula from this:

total sum = (n^2 + n) / 2
