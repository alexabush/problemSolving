# Two Eggs

## What is the problem?

a building has 100 floors
we want to know the highest floor we can drop an egg from and not break it

we can only break two eggs
any fall from < break height is okay

ideally, we want to use as few drops as possible

## Brainstorm

the easiest way to do this is linear
just go through until we break an egg, then return the floor one lower
