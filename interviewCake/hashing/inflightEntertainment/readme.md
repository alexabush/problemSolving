# Inflight Entertainment

## What's the problem?

We want to pick two movies from an array that have a runtime that will add up to a 'flightLength' variable

## Brainstorm

We can do a nested for loop and compare each pair until one equals flightLength.

Next solution is to sort the array, and then have a high low pointer move in from either side.
