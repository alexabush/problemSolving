# Superbalanced

**Definition**
a tree is 'superbalanced' if the difference between the depths of any two lead nodes is one or less

**Starting Code**
We are provided with a binary tree node constructor and insertLeft and insertRight methods that will insert a value into the tree

## Brainstorm

I suppose I'll try this with depth first search to start

we'll want to do dfs and keep track of the depth as we go
