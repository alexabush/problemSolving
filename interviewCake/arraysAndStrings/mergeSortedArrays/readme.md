# Merge Sorted Arrays

## What is the problem?

we have two arrays, we want to merge them into one
we have our lists sorted numerically

## Brainstorm

I already have a while loop version of this one based on merge sort, so I'll do it now. It's linear time and linear space (linear space is a neccesity unless I'm missing something)

## Debugging

I'm in an infinite loop and not sure why
JK I gave bad input data for my tests. Input data has to be sorted.
