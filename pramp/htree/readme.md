# H-Tree Construction

## Background

an h-tree is a geometric shape that consists of a repeating pattern resembling the letter 'h'

we make the h by drawing a line segment of whateer length we want, and then drawing two segments at the end of the line at right angles (the segments should be the same length as each other)

we'll continue to draw smaller h-trees at the end of each h-tree until the specified depth has been reached

each level deeper, the length of the tree should be half of the length of the tree in the previous depth

## What is the problem?

construct a function that will draw an h-tree using console.logs
inputs:

1. the center of the h-tree in the form of x and y coordinates
2. starting length
3. depth

we will make the starting line along the x axis specified
