# Connect All Siblings

## What is the problem?

given the root node of a binary tree where each node has a pointer to 'next', connect the sibling pointer to the next node in the same level

## Brainstorm

this is basically the exact problem I solved for 'connectAllSiblingsOnSameLevel'.

So....I'm just going to do that.
Do bfs over tree using a queue and add a pointer from the current node to the node next in the queue
