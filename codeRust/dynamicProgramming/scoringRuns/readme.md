# Scoring Runs

# What is the problem?

imaginary game where we can score 1, 2, or 4 runs

given total score 'n', calculate the TOTAL number of ways we can get to n using 1,2, and 4

## Smallest Input

0 => we will get 0 back
1 => we will get 1 back
2 => we will get 2 back
3 => we will get 3 back
4 => we will get 6
5 => we will get 10

## Brainstorm

how can we solve a smaller subproblem?

how can we get the answer for a larger number by knowing the answer for a smaller number
